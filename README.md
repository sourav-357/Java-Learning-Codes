# Java Programming Practice Repository 🚀

Welcome to my Java Learning Repository!  
This repository contains my learning journey codes, examples, exercises, and mini-programs created while mastering Java programming.

The codes are based on the **"Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers" by Tim Buchalka (Udemy)** — one of the most comprehensive courses for building a strong foundation in Java.
